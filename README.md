	Klára Sládečková, 2022

The bundle consists of two parts:
1. Input files containig [test data](testdata/).
2. Programs that show the [application of tunneling using ILP solver in sequence analysis](seqana/).

## General requirements
- GNU make

## Installation
The second part requires its own installations, so you may read the README included there.
